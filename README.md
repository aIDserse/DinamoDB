# DinamoDB (I know It's Called DynamoDB)
School project consisting in embedded data handling in .net with Amazon DynamoDB<br>
The program uses an Arduino to collect sensor devices, convert them into a Json and send them into the program.<br>
To use it you need an Arduino and an <a href="https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fmarketplace%2Fmanagement%2Fsignin%3Fstate%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Faws-mp-seller-management-portal&forceMobileApp=0&code_challenge=4tjUEaavKx8zfGfJdU2be5SiOiG4SjgWkeBohDQ1Ss0&code_challenge_method=SHA-256">Amazon AWS account</a><br>
The program uses a specific custom class simply named "Data.cs" and Arduino UNO to retrieve and handle the data, with Light, Water Level and DHT11 sensors. If you want to use a different type of Arduino or a different class you'll obviously have to edit it, but the methods are pretty universal and only the properties names will have to be changed.<br>
